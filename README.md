# Responsive Web Design Projects (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains my solutions for the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**.

The goal of this repo is not only to pass the FCC tests, but to build **clean, readable, and well-structured projects** that can also work as portfolio pieces.

---

## 🧠 What I focused on

- Semantic HTML
- Clean and readable CSS
- Flexbox layouts
- Accessibility basics
- Responsive design
- Gradual, phase-based development

Each project was built incrementally and then polished beyond the minimum FCC requirements.
